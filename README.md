# running experiments
Experiment 1 is split up into 3 python files.
  Part A and B will not need any inputs because it will not be reused for the other experiments.
  Part C will require input of learning rate and discount rate.

Experiment 2 will require input of learning rate and discount rate.

Experiment 3 is just running experiment 1c or 2 (we chose experiment 1) with the learning rates.

Experiment 4 is using the regular Q Learning algorithm (experiment 1c).
